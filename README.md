## CopernicuNetwork 

The goal of CopernicuNetwork is to enable Security Experts and IT Administrators to gain valuable insight into their networked participants. 

This project is currently being worked on and we hope to deliver more updates in the future. However, this software is provided as-is and should only be used by those who fully understand the implications of this software. 

### Original Idea

Our original idea was to map out a local-area network (LAN) for users to be able to easily find other devices to play LAN games with others. 

Since then it has evolved to better serve Security and IT personnel in an effort to map how many devices are using a specified network at a time. 

This project was founded utilizing two computer science principles: [Network mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_mapping) and [Ping sweeping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_sweep).

### Goals  

* Study effectively the connectivity between devices on a network.
* Work on any network
* Work on any desktop environment: 
  * MacOS Catalina
  * Debian Linux
  * Windows 10

### Notes 

Line 387 of gui.java for the MacOS Variant is hard-coded to look specifically for network device/interface that the Mac that this code was built on (en0), this may change based on your Mac machine.
